## KATA Description

Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

## Domain
- Verify if the numbers are equals, if so, return true, else return false because cannot build a triangle
